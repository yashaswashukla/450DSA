/**
 * The intution behind this solution is to search for the number of elements we can get from the smaller array and the rest of the elements
 * will be from the larger array.
 * Approach:
 * Apply binary search in an array with a small size. Start iterating with two pointers, say left and right. Find the middle of the range.
 * Take elements from low to middle of array1 and the remaining elements from the second array.
 * Then using the condition mentioned above, check if the left half is valid.
 * If valid, print the maximum of both arrayâ€™s last element.
 * If not, move the range towards the right if l2 > r1, else move the range towards the left if l1 > r2.
